Install GPU Operator in Proxy Environments
******************************************

Introduction
============

This page describes how to successfully deploy the GPU Operator in clusters behind an HTTP proxy.
By default, the GPU Operator requires internet access for the following reasons:

    1) Container images need to be pulled during GPU Operator installation.
    2) The ``driver`` container needs to download several OS packages prior to driver installation.

       .. tip::
          Using :doc:`precompiled-drivers` removes the need for the ``driver`` containers to
          download operating system packages.

To address these requirements, all Kubernetes nodes as well as the ``driver`` container need proper configuration
in order to direct traffic through the proxy.

This document demonstrates how to configure the GPU Operator so that the ``driver`` container can successfully
download packages behind a HTTP proxy. Since configuring Kubernetes/container runtime components to use
a proxy is not specific to the GPU Operator, we do not include those instructions here.

The instructions for Openshift are different, so skip the section titled :ref:`proxy_config_openshift` if you are not running Openshift.

Prerequisites
=============

* Kubernetes cluster is configured with HTTP proxy settings (container runtime should be enabled with HTTP proxy)

.. _proxy_config_openshift:

HTTP Proxy Configuration for Openshift
======================================

For Openshift, it is recommended to use the cluster-wide Proxy object to provide proxy information for the cluster.
Follow the procedure described in `Configuring the cluster-wide proxy <https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/networking/enable-cluster-wide-proxy.html>`_
from Red Hat Openshift public documentation. The GPU Operator will automatically inject proxy related ENV into the ``driver`` container
based on information present in the cluster-wide Proxy object.

HTTP Proxy Configuration
========================

First, get the ``values.yaml`` file used for GPU Operator configuration:

.. code-block:: console

  $ curl -sO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA/gpu-operator/${version}/deployments/gpu-operator/values.yaml

Specify ``driver.env`` in ``values.yaml`` with appropriate HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY, and NO_PROXY environment variables
(in both uppercase and lowercase).

.. code-block:: yaml

   driver:
      env:
      - name: HTTPS_PROXY
        value: http://<example.proxy.com:port>
      - name: HTTP_PROXY
        value: http://<example.proxy.com:port>
      - name: NO_PROXY
        value: <example.com>
      - name: https_proxy
        value: http://<example.proxy.com:port>
      - name: http_proxy
        value: http://<example.proxy.com:port>
      - name: no_proxy
        value: <example.com>

.. note::

   * Proxy related ENV are automatically injected by GPU Operator into the ``driver`` container to indicate proxy information used when downloading necessary packages.
   * If HTTPS Proxy server is setup then change the values of HTTPS_PROXY and https_proxy to use ``https`` instead.

Deploy GPU Operator
===================

Download and deploy GPU Operator Helm Chart with the updated ``values.yaml``.

Fetch the chart from the NGC repository:

.. code-block:: console

    $ helm fetch https://helm.ngc.nvidia.com/nvidia/charts/gpu-operator-${version}.tgz

Install the GPU Operator with updated ``values.yaml``:

.. code-block:: console

    $ helm install --wait gpu-operator \
         -n gpu-operator --create-namespace \
         gpu-operator-${version}.tgz \
         -f values.yaml

Check the status of the pods to ensure all the containers are running:

.. code-block:: console

   $ kubectl get pods -n gpu-operator
