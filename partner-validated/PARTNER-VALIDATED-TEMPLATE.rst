*************
Prerequisites
*************

Specify the conditions that the customer must meet before beginning to install
the NVIDIA GPU Operator.

References to product documentation are appropriate.

A few commands with brief example output that customers can run to verify their
readiness is appropriate.

A bulleted list is an effective presentation for simple and brief prerequisites
information, but is not required.

If the prerequisites are not simple and require running several commands to
verify readiness to begin, organize the commands or requirements into stages
and create a level 3 heading for each of the stages.


*********
Procedure
*********

You can keep the heading as Procedure, or you can replace with text similar to
Configuring |prod-name-short| with the GPU Operator.

If the procedure is in the range of 7 to 10 steps, then present them after
the heading.

If the procedure is more sophisticated, organize the steps into stages and
create a level 3 heading for each of the stages.
