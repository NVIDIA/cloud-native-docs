## Please report issues

Our qualification-testing procedures are constantly evolving and we might miss
certain problems. Please
[report](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-container-toolkit/issues) issues in
particular as they occur on a platform listed above.


## Other Linux distributions

Releases may work on more platforms than indicated in the table above (e.g., on distribution versions older and newer than listed).
Give things a try and we invite you to [report](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-container-toolkit/issues) any issue observed even if your Linux distribution is not listed.

----

1. The `arm64` / `aarch64` architecture includes support for Tegra-based systems.
2. For Amazon Linux 2023 on Arm64, a `g5g.2xlarge` Amazon EC2 instance was used for validation.
   The `g5g.xlarge` instance caused failures due to the limited system memory.
