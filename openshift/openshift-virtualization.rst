Introduction
************


There is a growing demand among Red Hat customers to use virtual GPUs (NVIDIA vGPU)
with Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization. Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization is based on KubeVirt, a
virtual machine (VM) management add-on to Kubernetes that allows you to run and manage VMs in
a Kubernetes cluster. It eliminates the need to manage separate clusters for VM and container workloads,
as both can now coexist in a single Kubernetes cluster. Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization is an
OpenShift feature to run virtual machines (VMs) orchestrated by OpenShift (Kubernetes).

Up until this point, the GPU Operator only provisioned worker nodes for running GPU-accelerated containers.
Now, the GPU Operator can also be used to provision worker nodes for running GPU-accelerated VMs.

The prerequisites needed for running containers and VMs with GPU(s) differs, with the primary difference
being the drivers required. For example, the datacenter driver is needed for containers, the vfio-pci driver
is needed for GPU passthrough, and the NVIDIA vGPU Manager is needed for creating vGPU devices.

The GPU Operator can now be configured to deploy different software components on worker nodes depending
on what GPU workload is configured to run on those nodes. Consider the following example.

| Node A is configured to run containers.
| Node B is configured to run VMs with Passthrough GPU.
| Node C is configured to run VMs with vGPU.

Node A receives the following software components:

* ``NVIDIA Datacenter Driver`` - To install the driver.
* ``NVIDIA Container Toolkit`` - To ensure containers can properly access GPUs.
* ``NVIDIA Kubernetes Device Plugin`` - To discover and advertise GPU resources to the kubelet.
* ``NVIDIA DCGM and DCGM Exporter`` - To monitor the GPU(s).

Node B receives the following software components:

* ``VFIO Manager`` - Optional. To load vfio-pci and bind it to all GPUs on the node.
* ``Sandbox Device Plugin`` - Optional. To discover and advertise the passthrough GPUs to the kubelet.

Node C receives the following software components:

* ``NVIDIA vGPU Manager`` - To install the driver.
* ``NVIDIA vGPU Device Manager`` - To create vGPU devices on the node.
* ``Sandbox Device Plugin`` -Optional. To discover and advertise the vGPU devices to kubelet.


******************************************
Assumptions, constraints, and dependencies
******************************************

* A worker node can run GPU-accelerated containers, or GPU accelerated VMs with GPU passthrough, or GPU accelerated-VMs with vGPU, but not a combination of any of them.

* The cluster admin or developer has knowledge about their cluster ahead of time, and can properly label nodes to indicate what types of GPU workloads they will run.

* Worker nodes running GPU accelerated VMs (with pGPU or vGPU) are assumed to be bare metal.

* MIG-backed vGPUs are not supported.

* The GPU Operator will not automate the installation of the vGPU guest driver inside KubeVirt VMs with vGPUs attached.

* There are two separate device plugins â€“ the NVIDIA k8s-device-plugin and the NVIDIA kubevirt-gpu-device-plugin.

* KubeVirt/Openshift virtualization provides built-in device plugins. These are the default tested device plugins.

*************
Prerequisites
*************

* `Install the OpenShift Virtualization Operator <https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/latest/html/virtualization/installing>`__.
* `Install the virtctl client <https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/latest/html/virtualization/getting-started#installing-virtctl_virt-using-the-cli-tools>`__.
* Starting with OpenShift Virtualization 4.12.3 and 4.13.0, set the ``disableMDevConfiguration`` feature gate:

  .. code-block:: console

     $ kubectl patch hyperconverged -n openshift-cnv  kubevirt-hyperconverged --type='json' -p='[{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/featureGates/disableMDevConfiguration", "value": true}]'

  *Example Output*

  .. code-block:: output

     hyperconverged.hco.kubevirt.io/kubevirt-hyperconverged patched


**********************************
Enabling the IOMMU driver on hosts
**********************************

To enable the IOMMU (Input-Output Memory Management Unit) driver in the kernel, create the ``MachineConfig`` object and add the kernel arguments.

Prerequisites
=============

* Administrative privilege to a working OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
* Intel or AMD CPU hardware.
* Intel Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O extensions or AMD IOMMU in the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) is enabled.

Procedure
=========

#. Create a ``MachineConfig`` object that identifies the kernel argument.
   The following example shows a kernel argument for an Intel CPU:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
      kind: MachineConfig
      metadata:
        labels:
          machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker
        name: 100-worker-iommu
      spec:
        config:
          ignition:
            version: 3.2.0
        kernelArguments:
            - intel_iommu=on

#. Create the new ``MachineConfig`` object:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ oc create -f 100-worker-kernel-arg-iommu.yaml

#. Verify that the new ``MachineConfig`` object was added:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ oc get machineconfig


*********************
Labeling worker nodes
*********************

Use the following command to add a label to a worker node:

.. code-block:: console

   $ oc label node <node-name> --overwrite nvidia.com/gpu.workload.config=vm-vgpu

You can assign the following values to the label: ``container``, ``vm-passthrough``, and ``vm-vgpu``.
The GPU Operator uses the value of this label to determine which operands to deploy.

If the node label ``nvidia.com/gpu.workload.config`` does not exist on the node, the GPU Operator assumes the default GPU workload configuration, ``container``, and deploys the software components needed to support this workload type.
To change the default GPU workload configuration, set the following value in ``ClusterPolicy``: ``sandboxWorkloads.defaultWorkload=<config>``.


*******************************
Building the vGPU Manager image
*******************************

.. note::

   Building a vGPU Manager image is only required for NVIDIA vGPU.
   If you plan to use GPU Passthrough only, skip this section.

Use the following steps to build the vGPU Manager container and push it to a private registry.

#. Download the vGPU Software from the `NVIDIA Licensing Portal <https://nvid.nvidia.com/dashboard/#/dashboard>`_.

   * Login to the NVIDIA Licensing Portal and navigate to the **Software Downloads** section.
   * The NVIDIA vGPU Software is located on the **Driver downloads** tab of the **Software Downloads** page.
   * Click the **Download** link for the Linux KVM complete vGPU package.
     Confirm that the **Product Version** column shows the vGPU version to install.
     Unzip the bundle to obtain the NVIDIA vGPU Manager for Linux file, ``NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-<version>-vgpu-kvm.run``.

   .. include:: ../gpu-operator/gpu-operator-kubevirt.rst
      :start-after: start-nvaie-run-file
      :end-before: end-nvaie-run-file

   Use the following steps to clone the driver container repository and build the driver image.

#. Open a terminal and clone the driver container image repository:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ git clone https://gitlab.com/nvidia/container-images/driver
      $ cd driver

#. Change to the ``vgpu-manager`` directory for your OS:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ cd vgpu-manager/rhel

#. Copy the NVIDIA vGPU Manager from your extracted zip file:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ cp <local-driver-download-directory>/*-vgpu-kvm.run ./

#. Set the following environment variables:

   * ``PRIVATE_REGISTRY`` - Name of the private registry used to store the driver image.
   * ``VERSION`` - The NVIDIA vGPU Manager version downloaded from the NVIDIA Software Portal.
   * ``OS_TAG`` - This must match the Guest OS version.
     For RedHat OpenShift, specify ``rhcos4.x`` where _x_ is the supported minor OCP version.
   * ``CUDA_VERSION`` - CUDA base image version to build the driver image with.

   .. code-block:: console

      $ export PRIVATE_REGISTRY=my/private/registry VERSION=510.73.06 OS_TAG=rhcos4.11 CUDA_VERSION=11.7.1

   .. note::

      The recommended registry to use is the Integrated OpenShift Container Platform registry.
      For more information about the registry, see `Accessing the registry <https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/registry/accessing-the-registry.html>`_.

#. Build the NVIDIA vGPU Manager image:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ docker build \
          --build-arg DRIVER_VERSION=${VERSION} \
          --build-arg CUDA_VERSION=${CUDA_VERSION} \
          -t ${PRIVATE_REGISTRY}/vgpu-manager:${VERSION}-${OS_TAG} .

#. Push the NVIDIA vGPU Manager image to your private registry:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ docker push ${PRIVATE_REGISTRY}/vgpu-manager:${VERSION}-${OS_TAG}

************************************************
Installing the NVIDIA GPU Operator using the CLI
************************************************

Install the NVIDIA GPU Operator using the guidance at :ref:`Installing the NVIDIA GPU Operator <install-nvidiagpu>`.

  .. note:: When prompted to create a cluster policy follow the guidance :ref:`Creating a ClusterPolicy for the GPU Operator<install-cluster-policy-vGPU>`.

Create the secret
=================

OpenShift has a secret object type which provides a mechanism for holding sensitive information such as passwords and private source repository credentials. Next you will create a secret object for storing your registry API key (the mechanism used to authenticate your access to the
private container registry).

.. note:: Before you begin you will need to generate or use an existingÂ API key for your private registry.

#. Navigate to **Home** > **Projects** and ensure the ``nvidia-gpu-operator`` is selected.

#. In the OpenShift Container Platform web console, click **Secrets** from the Workloads drop down.

#. Click the **Create** Drop down.

#. Select Image Pull Secret.

   .. image:: graphics/secrets.png

#. Enter the following into each field:

    * **Secret name**: private-registry-secret

    * **Authentication type**: Image registry credentials

    * **Registry server address**: <private-registry_address>

    * **Username**: $oauthtoken

    * **Password**: <API-KEY>

    * **Email**: <YOUR-EMAIL>

#. Click **Create**.

   A pull secret is created.

.. _install-cluster-policy-vGPU:


Creating a ClusterPolicy for the GPU Operator
=============================================

As a cluster administrator, you can create a ClusterPolicy using the OpenShift Container Platform CLI.
Create the cluster policy using the CLI:

#. Create the ClusterPolicy:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ oc get csv -n nvidia-gpu-operator gpu-operator-certified.v22.9.0 -ojsonpath={.metadata.annotations.alm-examples} | jq .[0] > clusterpolicy.json

#. Modify the ``clusterpolicy.json`` file as follows:

   .. note:: The ``vgpuManager`` options are only required if you want to use the NVIDIA vGPU. If you are only using GPU passthrough, these options should not be set.

   * sandboxWorloads.enabled=true
   * vgpuManager.enabled=true
   * vgpuManager.repository=<path to private repository>
   * vgpuManager.image=vgpu-manager
   * vgpuManager.version=<driver version>
   * vgpuManager.imagePullSecrets={<name of image pull secret>}

#. Apply the changes:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ oc apply -f clusterpolicy.json

   .. code-block:: console

      clusterpolicy.nvidia.com/gpu-cluster-policy created

The vGPU Device Manager, deployed by the GPU Operator, automatically creates vGPU devices which can be assigned to KubeVirt VMs.
Without additional configuration, the GPU Operator creates a default set of devices on all GPUs.
To learn more about how the vGPU Device Manager and configure which types of vGPU devices get created in your cluster, refer to :ref:`vGPU Device Configuration<vgpu-device-configuration>`.


*******************************************************
Add GPU Resources to the HyperConverged Custom Resource
*******************************************************

Update the ``HyperConverged`` custom resource so that all GPU and vGPU devices in your cluster are permitted and can be assigned to virtual machines.

The following example permits the A10 GPU device and A10-24Q vGPU device.

#. Determine the resource names for the GPU devices:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ oc get node cnt-server-2 -o json | jq '.status.allocatable | with_entries(select(.key | startswith("nvidia.com/"))) | with_entries(select(.value != "0"))'

   *Example Output*

   .. code-blocK:: output

      {
        "nvidia.com/NVIDIA_A10-12Q": "4"
      }

#. Determine the PCI device IDs for the GPUs.

   * You can search by device name in the `PCI IDs database <https://pci-ids.ucw.cz/v2.2/pci.ids>`_.

   * If you have host access to the node, you can list the NVIDIA GPU devices with a command like the following example:

     .. code-block:: console

        $ lspci -nnk -d 10de:

     *Example Output*

     .. code-block:: output
        :emphasize-lines: 1

        65:00.0 3D controller [0302]: NVIDIA Corporation GA102GL [A10] [10de:2236] (rev a1)
                Subsystem: NVIDIA Corporation GA102GL [A10] [10de:1482]
                Kernel modules: nvidiafb, nouveau

#. Modify the ``HyperConverged`` custom resource like the following partial example:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      ...
      spec:
        featureGates:
          disableMDevConfiguration: true
        permittedHostDevices:
          pciHostDevices:
          - externalResourceProvider: true
            pciDeviceSelector: 10DE:2236
            resourceName: nvidia.com/GA102GL_A10
          mediatedDevices:
          - externalResourceProvider: true
            mdevNameSelector: NVIDIA A10-24Q
            resourceName: nvidia.com/NVIDIA_A10-24Q
      ...

   Replace the values in the YAML as follows:

   * ``pciDeviceSelector`` and ``resourceName`` under ``pciHostDevices`` to correspond to your GPU model.

   * ``mdevNameSelector`` and ``resourceName`` under ``mediatedDevices`` to correspond to your vGPU type.

   * Set ``externalResourceProvider=true`` to indicate that this resource is provided by an external device plugin, in this case the ``sandbox-device-plugin`` that is deployed by the GPU Operator.

Refer to the `KubeVirt user guide <https://kubevirt.io/user-guide/virtual_machines/host-devices/#listing-permitted-devices>`_ for more information on the configuration options.


About Mediated Devices
======================

A physical device that is divided into one or more virtual devices. A vGPU is a type of mediated device
(mdev); the performance of the physical GPU is divided among the virtual devices. You can assign mediated
devices to one or more virtual machines (VMs), but the number of guests must be compatible with your GPU.
Some GPUs do not support multiple guests.


*************************************
Creating a virtual machine with GPU
*************************************

Assign GPU devices, either passthrough or vGPU, to virtual machines.

Prerequisites
=============

* The GPU devices are configured in the ``HyperConverged`` custom resource (CR).


Procedure
=========

#. Assign the GPU devices to a virtual machine (VM) by editing the ``spec.domain.devices.gpus`` field of the ``VirtualMachine`` manifest:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
      kind: VirtualMachine
      ...
      spec:
        domain:
          devices:
            gpus:
            - deviceName: nvidia.com/GA102GL_A10
              name: gpu1
            - deviceName: nvidia.com/GRID_T4-1Q
              name: gpu2
      ...

   * ``deviceName`` The resource name associated with the GPU.
   * ``name`` A name to identify the device on the VM.

..
  .. _vgpu-device-configuration:

**************************
vGPU Device Configuration
**************************

The vGPU Device Manager assists in creating vGPU devices on GPU worker nodes.

The vGPU Device Manager allows administrators to declaratively define a set of possible vGPU device configurations they would like applied to GPUs on a node.
At runtime, they then point the vGPU Device Manager at one of these configurations, and vGPU Device Manager takes care of applying it.

The configuration file is created as a ConfigMap, and is shared across all worker nodes.
At runtime, a node label, ``nvidia.com/vgpu.config``, can be used to decide which of these configurations to actually apply to a node at any given time.
If the node is not labeled, then the ``default`` configuration will be used.

For more information on this component and how it is configured, refer to the project `README <https://github.com/NVIDIA/vgpu-device-manager>`_.

By default, the GPU Operator deploys a ConfigMap for the vGPU Device Manager, containing named configurations for all `vGPU types <https://docs.nvidia.com/grid/latest/grid-vgpu-user-guide/index.html#supported-gpus-grid-vgpu>`_ supported by NVIDIA vGPU.
Users can select a specific configuration for a worker node by applying the ``nvidia.com/vgpu.config`` node label.

For example, labeling a node with ``nvidia.com/vgpu.config=A10-8Q`` would create 3 vGPU devices of type **A10-8Q** on all **A10** GPUs on the node (note: 3 is the maximum number of **A10-8Q** devices that can be created per GPU).
If the node is not labeled, the ``default`` configuration will be applied.

The ``default`` configuration will create Q-series vGPU devices on all GPUs, where the amount of framebuffer memory per vGPU device is half the total GPU memory.
For example, the ``default`` configuration will create two **A10-12Q** devices on all **A10** GPUs, two **V100-8Q** devices  on all **V100** GPUs, and two **T4-8Q** devices on all **T4** GPUs.

If custom vGPU device configuration is desired, more than the default ConfigMap provides, you can create your own ConfigMap:

   .. code-block:: console

       $ oc create configmap custom-vgpu-config -n gpu-operator --from-file=config.yaml=/path/to/file

And then configure the GPU Operator to use it by setting ``vgpuDeviceManager.config.name=custom-vgpu-config``.


Apply a New vGPU Device Configuration
=====================================

Apply a specific vGPU device configuration on a per-node basis by setting the ``nvidia.com/vgpu.config`` node label. It is recommended to set this node label prior to installing the GPU Operator if you do not want the default configuration applied.

Switching vGPU device configuration after one has been successfully applied assumes that no VMs with vGPU are currently running on the node. Any existing VMs will have to be shutdown/migrated first.

To apply a new configuration after GPU Operator install, simply update the ``nvidia.com/vgpu.config`` node label.

Let's run through an example on a system with two **A10** GPUs.

   .. code-block:: console

      $ nvidia-smi -L
      GPU 0: NVIDIA A10 (UUID: GPU-ebd34bdf-1083-eaac-2aff-4b71a022f9bd)
      GPU 1: NVIDIA A10 (UUID: GPU-1795e88b-3395-b27b-dad8-0488474eec0c)

After installing the GPU Operator as detailed in the previous sections and without labeling the node with ``nvidia.com/vgpu.config``, the ``default`` vGPU config get applied -- four **A10-12Q** devices get created (two per GPU):

   .. code-block:: console

      $ oc get node cnt-server-2 -o json | jq '.status.allocatable | with_entries(select(.key | startswith("nvidia.com/"))) | with_entries(select(.value != "0"))'
      {
        "nvidia.com/NVIDIA_A10-12Q": "4"
      }

If instead you want to create **A10-4Q** devices, we can label the node like such:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ oc label node <node-name> --overwrite nvidia.com/vgpu.config=A10-4Q

After the vGPU Device Manager finishes applying the new configuration, all GPU Operator pods should return to the Running state.

   .. code-block:: console

      $ oc get pods -n gpu-operator
      NAME                                                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
      ...
      nvidia-sandbox-device-plugin-daemonset-brtb6                  1/1     Running   0          10s
      nvidia-sandbox-validator-ljnwg                                1/1     Running   0          10s
      nvidia-vgpu-device-manager-8mgg8                              1/1     Running   0          30m
      nvidia-vgpu-manager-daemonset-fpplc                           1/1     Running   0          31m

You should now see 12 **A10-4Q** devices on the node, as 6 **A10-4Q** devices can be created per **A10** GPU.

   .. code-block:: console

      $ oc get node cnt-server-2 -o json | jq '.status.allocatable | with_entries(select(.key | startswith("nvidia.com/"))) | with_entries(select(.value != "0"))'
      {
        "nvidia.com/NVIDIA_A10-4Q": "12"
      }
